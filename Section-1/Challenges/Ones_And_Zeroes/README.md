# Ones And Zeroes
So I was going through the hard drive of a guy named Elen Tarung and I found this suspiscious file in a highly secret folder.
Unfortunately, it's encrypted and me being a n00b at cryptography can't make anything out of this (other than ofcourse, that it's in binary; I am not _that_ n00b).
Could you help me uncover the deep dark secret he was hiding underneath a secret folder he named "Bijiness Stuff"?
