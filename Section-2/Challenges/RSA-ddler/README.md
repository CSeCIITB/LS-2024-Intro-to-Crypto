As usual, all the super villains have escaped Arkham Asylum. When Batman reaches the Asylum, 
while investigating how they escaped, he is suddenly trapped by the Riddler in one of the cages.
He says "Detective you're always so predictable, always running towards the danger. 
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
Anyways I don't want to get carried away this time.
I have prepared zip file for you Batman, try to understand this using your tiny little brain and 
get the flag! That is the password to get out of the cage."

TL;DR take this zip file, unzip it (multiple times perhaps!) and using the output of the given
script find the flag!
Flag Format: YoS{...}
