NOTE: while you may be able to cheese through with use of tools like 'Rsactftool', it is advised that you actually go through
the standard attacks, their algorithms, and try all of them, maybe come up with your own attack in deciding how to get the plaintext from 
the ciphertext through different properties of the parameters. 

You have to upload the script(s) and write an explanation you used to get the flag.
